    <h1>Accessible Architecture in Schools</h1>
    <a href="https://tahmidawal.github.io/architectureANTBangla/" class="lang-button">Bangla</a>

    <p>Education is the cornerstone for personal development and societal progress. Accessible architecture within schools is a fundamental right ensuring that every student can engage in learning and social interactions without barriers.</p>

    <p>We delve into the significant impact of architectural design on the inclusivity and accessibility of educational settings. Exploring the challenges presented by physical obstacles we study look at accessible architectural approaches in context of South Asia</p>

    <p>The aim of this webpage is to make the information behind accessible architecture design accessible to as many people as possible so that anyone interested can look it up and go through it at a glance.</p>


    <h3>The Impact of Physical Barriers in Schools</h3>
    <img src="images/image28.png" alt="Poorly maintained school entry" class="image">

    <p>Physical barriers in schools can significantly hinder the participation and learning of students with disabilities by limited access, isolation, safety concerns, stigmatization, etc. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited Access:</strong> Obstacles like stairs or narrow doorways can prevent students with mobility issues from entering certain parts of the school.</li>
        <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Lack of access to common areas can leave students with disabilities feeling isolated and excluded, which impacts their social life.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> Unsafe conditions, such as slippery floors or poor lighting, pose risks to students in general, especially students with disabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Stigmatization:</strong> Physical barriers can also make students with disabilities feel marginalized as it highlights the difference from their peers and could lead to stigma.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>All the implementation or lack of implementation we see are a result of economic factors, lack of awareness or lack of expertise. Some of the main reasons behind the lack of accessible architecture are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of Awareness:</strong> There is a general lack of awareness among architects, designers, and policymakers about the importance of disability-related design and the specific needs of individuals with disabilities. This lack of awareness leads to a neglect of inclusive design principles in architectural practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Training:</strong> Architects and designers in South Asia often do not receive formal education or training on inclusive design practices for individuals with disabilities. Without proper training, professionals may not fully understand how to incorporate accessibility features into their designs.</li>
        <li><strong>Absence of Mandates:</strong> The absence of mandatory accessibility standards and guidelines for school design in India contributes to the lack of emphasis on disability-related design. Without clear regulations requiring inclusive design practices, architects may not prioritize accessibility features in their projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Considerations:</strong> Implementing disability-related design features can sometimes be perceived as costly and may require additional resources. In a context where budget constraints are common, architects and builders may prioritize cost-efficiency over inclusive design.</li>
        <li><strong>Perception of Disability:</strong> Negative attitudes and misconceptions about disability in society can influence design decisions. Architects may not fully understand the diverse needs of individuals with disabilities or may underestimate the impact of physical barriers on their daily lives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Objectives of This Webpage</h3>
    <p>Through this webpage, we will identify common architectural barriers in schools and discuss solutions and strategies to overcome them. This content is intended for educational purposes for anyone interested in learning more about accessible architecture.</p>


    <h3>Entry / Exit</h3>
    <p>In many cases in South Asia, the entry or exit to the school is muddy or there are some sorts of barriers. In some of these situations, there are stairs but no ramp to access. This causes issues for students with disabilities to access the building.</p>
    <img src="images/image8.png" alt="Poorly maintained school entry" class="image">
    <p style="font-size: smaller;">Image collected from unicef.org</p>
    <p>The school needs to ensure there is a well-maintained, firm, and level surface for entry or exit. This makes sure students using a wheelchair can independently come in and go out of the school.</p>


    <h3>Ramp</h3>
    <p>Ramps are needed as a replacement for stairs. Since students need to access or go upstairs, in many scenarios there are either problems with the ramp being blocked or an unmaintained ramp.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, ramps are designed without considering basic architecture or even physics principles. This often causes issues with using the ramp for the main purpose of what they were designed for at the first place</p>
    <img src="images/image4.png" alt="Blocked ramp" class="image">
    <p style="font-size: smaller;">Image reproduced from unicef.com</p>
    <p>There is a ramp but if we notice closer, on the other end there are objects placed which would make accessing the ramp more difficult.</p>
    <img src="images/image11.png" alt="Steep ramp design" class="image">
    <p style="font-size: smaller;">Image reproduced from unicef.com</p>

    <p style="font-size: smaller;">Image reproduced from unicef.com</p>
    <p>We notice a very steep ramp but the designer added grooves for increasing friction but this would likely not solve the problem because that would also introduce an additional challenge going up the ramp.</p>
    <img src="images/image5.png" alt="Unmaintained ramp surface" class="image">
    <p>This is a classic example of an unmaintained ramp. At the same time, we notice that the surface of the ramp seems to be very smooth which would likely make it difficult to go up. Below is are the architectural samples of how the infrastructure of a ramp should look like where the ramp should be rigid and level. It should also be made sure that the surface of the ramp should have the appropriate grooves and it should be on the side of stairs to make sure they don’t obstruct the path: </p>

    <img src="images/image6.png" alt="Steep ramp design" class="image">
    <p style="font-size: smaller;">Image reproduced from unicef.com</p>
    <p>As seen below, the ramp should not have a gradient or slope higher than 1 to 12. </p>
    <img src="images/image23.png" alt="Steep ramp design" class="image">
    <p style="font-size: smaller;">Image reproduced from unicef.com</p>
    <p>Below is an example of how a ramp should look like with a surface that has proper surface friction, railings and a decent slope:</p>

    <h3>Stairs</h3>
    <p>In many scenarios in schools and other places, the stairs are often ill-maintained. This probably happens due to the lack of funding for maintenance and planning. This adds an additional layer of complication for visually impaired students or students who have injuries.</p>
    <img src="images/image12.png" alt="Ill-maintained stairs" class="image">
    <p>Below is an example of how it should be designed with stripes or coloring to show the contrast and adding additional friction grooves to the stairs to make sure there's a less likelihood of slipping.</p>

    <p>Below is an example of how it looks like when a staircase is properly designed. </p>

    <h3>Signage</h3>
    <p>Signage is another element that is almost non-existent at South Asian schools. This causes difficulty for students to navigate, especially if it's a large school. As a result, it's important to consider installing signs at proper head clearance space around 1000mm high with contrasting colors for better visibiliy.</p>

    <h3>Doors</h3>
    <p>Designing proper and wide enough doors is very important to ensure that the classroom or facility is accessible to everyone. From personal experience, I have noticed there to be bumps at the bottom of the doorway to keep rainwater out. This could potentially create complications for students accessing the classroom.</p>
    <img src="images/image26.png" alt="Accessible door design" class="image">
    <p>A proper design of a door looks like one with a D handle, kick plate, and being able to see through the door. Also, the addition of an automatic door opener could vastly improve accessibility issues.</p>

    <h3>Classrooms</h3>
    <p>In many scenarios, there is often a lack of basic classroom equipment at the classroom which needs to be taken into consideration. In most cases, it's due to a lack of funding, but we still need to consider the necessary design.</p>
    <img src="images/image20.png" alt="Classroom layout for accessibility" class="image">

    <h4>Desks and Benches</h4>
    <p>Instead of just having uniform benches, there needs to be special benches for students who require that. However, it's not necessarily a financially difficult decision. As long as the authorities are willing to do that, it should be able to be done.</p>
    <img src="images/image2.png" alt="Adjustable classroom benches" class="image">
    <p>In order to make the desks more accessible, the designers could order benches that are higher or adjustable. And leave some row or some section with higher space.</p>
    <img src="images/image18.png" alt="Accessible desk designs" class="image">

    <h4>Flooring</h4>
    <p>In many scenarios, I found very ill-maintained floors which I also got to observe during my days in Bangladesh. Such ill-maintenance can be very dangerous.</p>
    <img src="images/image22.png" alt="Poorly maintained flooring" class="image">
    <img src="images/image16.png" alt="Well-maintained school flooring" class="image">

    <h3>Playground</h3>
    <p>Playgrounds are very important places for socializing and recess, especially for children. In order to improve such places, a few very simple things are needed to be considered.</p>

    <img src="images/image19.png" alt="Accessible playground" class="image">
    <p>A playground can be made more accessible by adding a paved path from the school to the playground, adding ramps if there is a difference in the level. It also needs to be ensured that there is sufficient grass to lessen the chances of children getting hurt.</p>
    <img src="images/image14.png" alt="Safe playground design" class="image">

    <h3>Toilets</h3>
    <p>Unmaintained toilets and toilets without the proper design make them inaccessible to students with locomotor disabilities.</p>
    <img src="images/image25.png" alt="Inaccessible toilet example" class="image">
    <img src="images/image3.png" alt="Poor toilet design" class="image">
    <p>In order to make toilets accessible, western toilets with installing handles the proper way needs to be done.</p>
    <img src="images/image15.png" alt="Accessible toilet design" class="image">
    <p>Below are some examples of toilets designed in an accessible way.</p>
