        <h1>Inclusive Educational Design</h1>
        <p>We explore into the archictural guide for accessible schooling and the progress of making education accessible to students in South Asia. By examining the disparities in current educational facilities and proposing actionable guidelines, this thesis argues that mandated inclusive design training for architects and educators, alongside the development of comprehensive design standards, can significantly enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of educational environments.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Inclusive Design</h2>
        <p>Inclusive design in education ensures that educational environments are accessible and supportive for all students irrespective of their abilities. It involves inclusive teaching practices, resources, and curricula designed to engage every student and is founded on universal design for learning principles.</p>

        <h2>Insights from Recent Research</h2>
        <h3>Understanding Accessible Architecture in School Design</h3>
        <img src="why.png" alt="Street view of a school building showcasing inclusive architectural elements">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of Disability Awareness:</strong> Many architects show a limited understanding of physical disability, impacting their ability to design fully accessible educational facilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Need for Mandated Training:</strong> The study asks for  disability training for architects to foster inclusive and accessible school designs.</li>
            <li><strong>Standards for Disability-Friendly Design:</strong> Establishing specific design standards could ensure that schools are built to accommodate children with disabilities effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Child Involvement in Design:</strong> Including children in the design process can help create more child-friendly and inclusive school spaces that promote meaningful participation and social interaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The study underscores the importance of integrating inclusive design principles into architectural education and practice to enhance access and participation for all students, particularly those with physical disabilities.</p>
